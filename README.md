# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
My answers to practice problems found in Robert Lafore's Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition).

## What is it?

This is a collection of practice problems and answers from Data Structures & Algorithms in Java (2nd Edition) by Robert Lafore. This book and these practice problems were and important part of my self-learning of important data structures in Java and general algorithmic practice. Each class represents a concept from the book, and the questions posed by the book are included within the class comments.

## What did I practice?

The following topics are covered by the book, all of which I've practiced in some way:
- Arrays (unordered and ordered)
- Linked lists (single and double-ended, sorted, and doubly linked lists)
- Restricted access data structures (stacks, queues, and priority queues)
- Trees (binary search, red-black, 2-3-4 tree, and heaps)
- Hash tables (open addressing and separate chaining)
- Graphs (unweighted and weighted)
- Simple sorting (bubble, selection, insertion, and odd-even sort)
- Advanced sorting (shellsort, partitioning, quicksort, heapsort, and radix sort)
- Recursion
